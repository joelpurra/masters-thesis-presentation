        <h2>What is tracking?</h2>
        <p>When browsing online, information is recorded by the servers you communicate directly with. When visiting a website, resources from other services might be requested as well -- with or without being visible.</p>
        <p><strong>Assumption: </strong>all third-party resources have server logs and/or analytics software to record your online habits.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each third-party resource leaks <em>at least some</em> user information.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Information can be <em>passively recorded</em> during transmission; some of which can't be avoided.</li>
            <li>Specialized tracking code can <em>actively extract</em> extended information.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <aside>
          <ul>
            <li>This happens in all common browsers.</li>
            <li>Both passive and active tracking data is extensively collected and used.</li>
            <li>Third-party resources may be part of a commercial service, which monetizes information about users.</li>

        <h2>Why is tracking used?</h2>
        <p>Information is collected and stored to gain knowledge about the visitors a website has. The purpose differs depending on the perspective.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Website owners: to improve content (what is interesting).</li>
          <li>Social networks: to improve user and network knowledge (interests).</li>
          <li>Advertisment firms: to sell more targeted ads (based on interests).</li>
          <li>Media analytics firms: to verify statistics (for advertisements).</li>
          <li>Data brokers: to package and sell user data (inferred from interests).</li>
        </ul>
        <aside>
          <p>Information inferred from interests include gender, age, social class, income, religion, political views and more. Basically anything. This can also be done from for example search terms or Facebook likes.</p>
          <p>Information becomes more useful and valuable over time, as more and more data points can be connected to the same user.</p>
