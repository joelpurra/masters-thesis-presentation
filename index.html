        <h2>What is tracking?</h2>
        <p>When browsing online, information is recorded by the servers you communicate directly with. When visiting a website, resources from other services might be requested as well -- with or without being visible.</p>
        <p><strong>Assumption: </strong>all third-party resources have server logs and/or analytics software to record your online habits.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each third-party resource leaks <em>at least some</em> user information.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Information can be <em>passively recorded</em> during transmission; some of which can't be avoided.</li>
            <li>Specialized tracking code can <em>actively extract</em> extended information.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>This happens in all common browsers.</li>
          <li>Both passive and active tracking data is extensively collected and used.</li>
          <li>Third-party resources may be part of a commercial service, which monetizes information about users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What does this thesis show?</h2>
        <p>By downloading websites from over 150.000 domains, it is shown how common third-party resource usage is.</p>
        <p>Focuses on difference between domain classes, between secure and insecure domains, and analyzing known trackers.</p>
        <p><strong>Domain classes: </strong> Random, top and curated. Focus is on Sweden.</p>

        <h2 class="bullet">What are third-party resources?</h2>
        <p>A resource belonging to the origin's <em>primary domain</em> is called <em>internal</em>. Otherwise it's an <em>external</em> resource.</p>
        <p><strong>Assumption: </strong>any external resource is a third-party resource.</p>

      <section data-bespoke-hash="what-is-passive-tracking">
        <h2 class="bullet">What is passive tracking?</h2>
        <p>Collecting information that is required to retrieve the resource as part of the HTTP standard, or inferrable from observing network traffic.</p>
        <ul class="smaller">
          <li>Where in the world the user is, often down to street level. Which ISP.</li>
          <li>Timestamps; if the domain has been requested before and how often.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyone can listen in anywhere along the network path, unless HTTPS is used. HTTPS prevents <em>passive </em> tracking of the following:</p>
        <ul class="smaller">
          <li>Exactly which page is visited.</li>
          <li>The browser's make/model/version, operating system, computer/pad/phone.</li>
          <li>Selected browser language, some settings.</li>
          <li>If this page, or any other page, loading the same resource has been visited before (using for example cookies, Etags, resource timestamps).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The server from which a resource is loaded from can always log and analyze these properties, even if HTTPS is used.</p>
        <p class="bullet"><a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/att-charges-29-more-for-gigabit-fiber-that-doesnt-watch-your-web-browsing/">AT&amp;T charges $29 per month </a>to <em>not</em> passively track their users. Verizon covertly installs additional tracking cookies.</p>
      </section>
      <section data-bespoke-hash="what-is-active-tracking">
        <h2 class="bullet">What is active tracking?</h2>
        <p>A script or plugin executed in the browser to extract and collect <em>extended </em> information. Can already collect all of the passive properties by default, even when using HTTPS.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Time spent on each page, even if inactive.</li>
          <li>Window size, screen resolution, color depth.</li>
          <li>Mouse movements, scrollbar location.</li>
          <li>Installed fonts, plugins and extensions.</li>
          <li>Error reporting if problems occur.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Analytics services: Google Analytics, Alexa, comScore, Gaug.es, New Relic. Ad companies collect this type of information as well, but don't share it back in the same way.</p>
        <p class="bullet">Also used for fairly exact, reliable, and global <em>browser fingerprinting</em>. Single user browsers therefore effectively have user fingerprints, even if never logged in anywhere. Cookies aren't usually necessary, and they have been ignored in this thesis.</p>

      <section data-bespoke-hash="why-is-tracking-used">
        <h2>Why is tracking used?</h2>
        <p>Information is collected and stored to gain knowledge about the visitors a website has. The purpose differs depending on the perspective.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Website owners: to improve content (what is interesting).</li>
          <li>Social networks: to improve user and network knowledge (interests).</li>
          <li>Advertisment firms: to sell more targeted ads (based on interests).</li>
          <li>Media analytics firms: to verify statistics (for advertisements).</li>
          <li>Data brokers: to package and sell user data (inferred from interests).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information inferred from interests include gender, age, social class, income, religion, political views and more. Basically anything. This can also be done from for example search terms or Facebook likes.</p>
        <p>Information becomes more useful and valuable over time, as more and more data points can be connected to the same user.</p>

          <li>Users lose control over who they share information with. This can be considered an <em>invasion of privacy</em>.</li>
