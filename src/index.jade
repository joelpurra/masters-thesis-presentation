          p Analytics services: Google Analytics, Alexa, comScore, Gaug.es, New Relic. Ad companies collect this type of information as well, but don't share it back in the same way.

            em browser fingerprinting
            | . Single user browsers therefore effectively have user fingerprints, even if never logged in anywhere. Cookies aren't usually necessary, and they have been ignored in this thesis.

        p Information is collected and stored to gain knowledge about the visitors a website has. The purpose differs depending on the perspective.

          li Website owners: to improve content (what is interesting).

          li Media analytics firms: to verify statistics (for advertisements).
          li Data brokers: to package and sell user data (inferred from interests).
        aside
          p Information inferred from interests include gender, age, social class, income, religion, political views and more. Basically anything. This can also be done from for example search terms or Facebook likes.
          p Information becomes more useful and valuable over time, as more and more data points can be connected to the same user.
